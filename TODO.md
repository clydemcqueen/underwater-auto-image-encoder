This is the project todo list.

[x] Set up the local development environment using vscode dev containers to keep dependencies isolated and ensure a consistent development environment across different machines.
[x] Create a script for automating the preprocessing steps, including GPR to RAW conversion and image cropping.
[x] Select the ML framework (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) for building the autoencoder.
[x] Design the autoencoder model architecture.
[x] Implement the autoencoder model architecture using the selected machine learning framework.
[x] Train the autoencoder model on the preprocessed dataset.
[] Evaluate the model's performance and make necessary adjustments.
[] Integrate the trained model into the output processing pipeline.
