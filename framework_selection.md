# ML Framework Selection for Underwater Image Enhancement

## Project Requirements
- Process high-resolution images (4606 x 4030)
- Image-to-image translation (RAW to enhanced JPEG)
- Match manual Lightroom editing quality
- Handle underwater-specific challenges (color cast, low contrast, haze)

## Framework Comparison

### PyTorch
**Pros:**
- More flexible and pythonic API
- Easier debugging with dynamic computation graphs
- Strong community support for computer vision research
- Most recent underwater enhancement papers use PyTorch (U-shape Transformer, Semi-UIR)
- Better integration with modern vision transformers
- Easier to implement custom loss functions and architectures

**Cons:**
- Slightly steeper learning curve for production deployment
- Less built-in production optimization tools

**Relevant Implementations:**
- U-shape Transformer for Underwater Enhancement (PyTorch)
- Semi-UIR (PyTorch)
- Most recent SOTA image enhancement models

### TensorFlow/Keras
**Pros:**
- Better production deployment tools (TF Lite, TF Serving)
- Keras provides high-level API for quick prototyping
- Good for standard architectures
- Better mobile/edge deployment options

**Cons:**
- Less flexible for research/experimentation
- Harder to debug with static graphs (though TF 2.x improved this)
- Fewer recent underwater enhancement implementations

## Recommendation: PyTorch

### Reasoning:
1. **Research Flexibility**: Your project requires experimentation with different architectures to match manual editing quality
2. **Community Support**: Most underwater enhancement research uses PyTorch
3. **Reference Implementations**: Can leverage existing PyTorch implementations like U-shape Transformer
4. **Custom Loss Functions**: Easier to implement perceptual losses, color correction losses specific to underwater images
5. **Modern Architectures**: Better support for transformer-based models which show SOTA results

## Proposed Architecture Approaches (PyTorch)

### Option 1: U-Net Based Autoencoder
- Proven for image-to-image translation
- Good at preserving spatial information
- Skip connections help maintain detail

### Option 2: Transformer-Based (U-shape Transformer)
- State-of-the-art for underwater enhancement
- Better global context understanding
- Can adapt existing implementation

### Option 3: Hybrid CNN-Transformer
- Combine local feature extraction (CNN) with global context (Transformer)
- Balance between performance and computational cost

## Next Steps
1. Set up PyTorch project structure
2. Implement baseline U-Net autoencoder
3. Experiment with advanced architectures
4. Create custom loss functions for underwater characteristics
